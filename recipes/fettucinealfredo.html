                    Fettuccine alfredo is my favorite food. I love alfredo because it is creamy and decadent. I don’t remember the first time I ever had it, I just know I was young. It was a staple dinner throughout my childhood. My mom would always make it on weekends as a treat.

                <h2>Background on Fettuccine Alfredo</h2>
                <p> In America, we consider fettuccine alfredo to be Italian food. However, they don’t eat it in Italy, at least not how we eat it in the states. Here, alfredo sauce is made with heavy whipping cream and butter at its base. This makes a thick, creamy sauce. In Italy, it’s a simple 3 ingredient sauce; noodles, butter and parmesan cheese. This sauce is still flavorful, but a lot lighter than American alfredo.

                    Authentic Fettuccine Alfredo was created in 1908. Chef Alfredo’s wife had lost her appetite after giving birth. He made fresh pasta and dressed it in butter and parmesan in an attempt to get her to eat. Luckily, she loved it and the rest is history. It is unknown where the American version of alfredo originated from.
